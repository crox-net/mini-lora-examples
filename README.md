# mini-lora-examples
Some very basic example code for the "Mini Lora Node" PCB - in the hope that it will be useful for others.

My goal is to eventually provide a ready-to-use example where you can just add your custom sensors reading etc.

I'm not there yet myself, but in the meanwhile this should get you started, feel free to contribute!
